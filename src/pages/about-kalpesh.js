        <p>Hello reader, I'm Kalpesh Singh.</p>

          This website is built for you. You to learn about Japan and read my
          experiences to make your trip better.

        <p>
          I have planned, visited and maximized my experiences in India doing a
          few solo trips. These trips include Ladakh, Andaman Islands, Meghalaya
          and many more.

          A year and a few months back I moved to Bengaluru to join Amazon as
          Software Engineer. At that time, I decided that I should make one more
          bold move and go for my first international travel and that too solo
          in a country where food and language will be a challenge. That's how I
          decided to go to Japan üáØüáµ.

          and a few random videos and channels on YouTube were always
          educational and inspired me to go to this country and gain the
          first-hand experience.

          I put my energy, time and a few dollars to bring this website and
          information to you. I don't{" "}
