        <p>Hello reader, I'm Kalpesh Singh.</p>
        <p>
          I have been solo traveling for last 4 years. I have visited Ladakh,
          Andaman Islands, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Kerala and many more. I have
          planned, visited and maximized my experiences in India doing a few
          solo trips.

        <p>
          So this time I got to apply my travel expertise for my first International travel. I
          hope this guide will help you to learn about Japan and my
          experiences will help you to plan your trip better.

          In August 2018, I joined Amazon as Frontend Engineer and moved to
          Bengaluru. At that time, I decided that I should make one more bold
          move and go for my first international travel in a country where food
          and language will be a challenge. That's how I decided to go to Japan

          and a few other videos and channels on YouTube were always educational
          and inspired me to go to this country and see it for myself.
