          I’ve finished my breakfast in my Osaka hostel and waiting for my towel
          to dry before I leave for Kyoto. It was time to leave Osaka and
          explore Nara and Kyoto prefectures. I found one cheap hostel with
          breakfast in Kyoto named Guest House Oumi.
        </p>
        <p>
          My check in time is 05:00 in the evening but if I want to keep my
          luggage then I have to reach there by 01:00 p.m. I also have to book
          bus for Tokyo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isn't it weird that check in times are usually after 01:00 PM in
          Japan. I bet this is because this cleanliness obsessed country needs
          more time in making your bed and experience perfect.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I think I will head to Kyoto, keep my luggage and go explore places
          but before that I have to make a plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I booked the bus from Kyoto to Tokyo in hostel itself and then left
          for Kyoto. It took me more than an hour to reach my new destination.
          So far I loved the city. It's like you are in the countryside of
          Japan. My guesthouse is amazing. I decided to do three things before I
          go to the guest house. I will visit a nearby castle, shrine and at
          last will do Onsen. It will be fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I'm again at Doutor coffee. I had a chicken sandwich and had
          a cold coffee. The Nijō castle will get closed at 05:00 PM. I will
          visit castle first then Shrine (Money shrine) then Onsen near my
          guesthouse. Seems like I have to prepare myself for walking because
          it's Kyoto and I don't see much public transport.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was so tired that I couldn't cover the Imperial Palace. Anyway
          that's the same as other Imperial Palace.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to do Onsen and I walk 3 kilometres and reached there. I paid
          for Onsen and bought a ¥100 towel from them. As soon as I went there I
          saw people were naked. They were either going for Onsen or done with
          it. I didn't feel shy and removed my clothes. I went first to clean my
          body (same rule when you go for swimming) and then went for Onsen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw that hot bath has a bigger space. So I waited for a few minutes.
          I was shy but people were casually walking naked and I was trying to
          be calm and pretending that this is not new to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn’t go to open bath area as I was feeling shy. I was the only
          foregin tourist there and it was a bit odd for me. I spent some time
          there and then it was time to go to the hostel after around 8-10 Kms.
          of walk in 36 °C.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to the hostel where I met one Japanese old person. He was
          trying to communicate in English and told me that he was in India 20
          years ago. He was a nice and funny guy.
        </p>
        <p>
          He helped me with transport to Arashiyama in English and Japanese.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          He called the hostel staff and I got my bed. Tommy (owner of hostel )
          explained to me about hostel facilities. He spoke in the style like
          magician speaks with audience. I wanted to buy 2 days pass of Kyoto
          city so I went to the station (Nijō station). I decided to get pass
          tomorrow and settled in KFC and had my dinner. KFC Chicken, french
          fries and cola.
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn’t eat the entire chicken but was feeling good after getting
          something in my stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to the hostel which was only 3 minutes walk from the station. I
          set an alarm for 06:00 AM and went to sleep.

          I woke up at 06:00 AM and got ready by 07:00 AM. I had my breakfast
          and left for Arashiyama Bamboo Grove.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is a 10 minutes train ride from Nijō station. I went there and
          explored one shrine. I took some amazing photos. When I was leaving
          the forest I met Dashintha. We greeted each other and I left. I had
          two more places to cover which was Kimono forest and one bridge. I met
          Dashintha again and we planned to explore the rest of the day
          together.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spotted owl cafe and Japan known for weird cafes. We both agreed to
          go and experience it. We paid ¥600-¥800 and went inside with basic
          instructions. Though they don’t serve coffee but you can buy combine
          entry for owl and cat cafes where you can drink coffee.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was an amazing experience. We took lots of good photos and had fun
          with owls. After that we decided to go to Kyoto station for lunch.
          After struggling to find Yoshinoya we had to settle for McChicken
          burger. After eating we went to Kiyomizu-dera and spent a few hours
          there.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was almost sunset and we rushed to Fushimi Inari Taisha. A place
          where many torii gates are there. At this point, I was exhausted.
          Though with rest at multiple points we were able to hike to the top
          and the view was worthy. We sat there for half an hour and then
          decided to leave for our destinations. We bought beers and I was
          drinking while walking and in the train.
        </p>

        <p>
          He alighted at the next station from Fushimi and i got down at Nijō
          station. I went to KFC and ordered medium size french fries and a
          vegetable stuff. It was my dinner and then I went to sleep. The day
          was long and it was interesting to learn about Japaneses culture from
          an outsider who was living here for more than 1.5 years.
